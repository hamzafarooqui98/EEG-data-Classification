# EEG-data-Classification
The project is based on the classification of EEG data to classify low and High workload on human mental state. The project is first executed using custom made logistic model to classify the workload and a pre-defined Neural architecture based on Convolution Neural Network is executed to check the real accuracy of the EEG classification.
