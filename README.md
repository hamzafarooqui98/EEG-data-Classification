# EEG-data-Classification
The following project is based on the classification of EEG data to classify low and High workload on human mental state. 

- The project is first executed using custom made logistic model to classify the workload which can be observed in file `Custom_Logistic_Model.ipynb`.
- In connection to this a pre-defined Neural architecture based on Convolution Neural Network is put into effect to check the real accuracy of the EEG classification evident in the file `DeepLearning-CNN-Model.ipynb`. The mean accuracy from the CNN was 82%.
